--[ How to deploy
1. Fill in the right settings for the database
   connection in the settings.py file. Alternatively,
   one could use a SQLite database and change the
   connection creation and script exit functions to
   connect to the SQLite database and to commit before exit.
2. Change the server's config file to use some authentication
   or pass the username in some other way  to the script.
3. Set the "admin" user in the settings.py file.


--[ Usage
To start off, login as "admin" and add users to the system
by issuing the command `add user1 user2 user3`.

Other usage examples are given on the webpage itself.
